## TL;DR

Organizations must develop a systematic approach to identify and prioritize GenAI initiatives by combining bottom-up ideas with top-down strategic priorities. Each potential use case should be evaluated based on business value and feasibility, often using an impact-versus-feasibility matrix to identify high-priority projects. While quick wins are important, organizations should focus on developing interconnected capabilities that create a foundation for future success, avoiding isolated pilots in favor of projects that build upon each other and contribute to a strategic flywheel effect.

## Value Identification and Prioritization 

With a clear vision and business alignment established, organizations must then systematically identify and prioritize specific GenAI initiatives. This requires a well-defined procedure for evaluating, prioritizing, and continuously monitoring potential use cases. One effective approach is to solicit AI use case ideas from across business units (bottom-up) while mapping them to strategic priorities (top-down), creating a funnel of potential projects that can be evaluated systematically.

To prioritize effectively, assess each use case on two main dimensions: its potential business value and its feasibility (or actionability). Business value includes factors like impact on revenue/cost, alignment to top objectives, or competitive advantage gained. Feasibility encompasses technical complexity, data readiness, ease of integration, and time-to-value. Many organizations visualize this in an impact-versus-feasibility matrix, plotting use cases to identify a "priority zone" where high-value, high-feasibility projects reside. For example, a use case that could "move the needle" on a core metric and can be implemented with available data and technology will rank high, whereas an idea with uncertain value or heavy technical hurdles might be slated for later exploration.

When applying this prioritization, organizations should identify both immediate opportunities and the strategic building blocks that will enable future success. While starting with 'small wins' that demonstrate tangible results—such as automating frequently asked questions via a GenAI chatbot—the key is to recognize how these initial projects fit into a broader ecosystem of interconnected capabilities. By mapping commonalities across use cases, organizations can develop phased roadmaps where each initiative contributes to a foundational flywheel effect. Focus and coherence are key: avoid diluting effort on disconnected, low-impact pilots. Studies show that AI leaders achieve significantly higher ROI by going deeper on interconnected opportunities that build upon each other. Organizations should create a ranked backlog of GenAI use cases, evaluating them not only on immediate criteria (value, alignment, feasibility) but also on their potential to establish reusable capabilities and accelerate future projects. This is particularly crucial for organizations viewing AI as a strategic pillar, as it enables them to balance quick wins with the systematic development of foundational capabilities. By continuously updating this backlog as projects prove value and new opportunities arise, organizations can ensure their GenAI investments create both immediate impact and long-term competitive advantage
