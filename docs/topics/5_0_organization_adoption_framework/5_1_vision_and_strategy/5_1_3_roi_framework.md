## TL;DR

A disciplined ROI framework for GenAI projects requires mapping the complete value chain from technical capabilities to measurable business outcomes, including both tangible benefits (cost savings, revenue gains) and intangible benefits (customer satisfaction, strategic advantages). Comprehensive cost analysis should account for development, infrastructure, talent, training, and maintenance, while establishing clear baselines and monitoring metrics throughout the project lifecycle. Success depends on continuous evaluation using granular value chain tracking to identify and address performance gaps, with realistic timelines for ROI that balance quick wins against longer-term strategic transformations.

## ROI Framework
Once high-priority initiatives are identified, a disciplined ROI framework ensures these GenAI projects deliver their intended business value. Leaders should develop a pragmatic business case for each significant GenAI project, forecasting expected benefits, costs, and risks. Start by mapping the complete value chain—from specific GenAI features through to their ultimate business impact. This means clearly articulating how each technical capability drives specific operational improvements that lead to measurable business outcomes.

Next, estimate benefits in both tangible and intangible terms. Tangible benefits might include dollar savings (e.g., automating a process saves $X million in labor) or revenue gains (e.g., personalization upsell increases sales by Y%) over a given period. Intangible or strategic benefits – such as improved customer satisfaction, faster decision-making, or building a data advantage – should also be noted, even if they're harder to quantify. On the cost side, account for development and cloud infrastructure costs, talent and training, integration efforts, and ongoing maintenance. With anticipated benefits and costs defined, calculate a rough ROI or payback period for the project to inform prioritization and set expectations. Also plan for a range of expected outcomes - a high and a low case.

This ROI planning must translate into a continuous evaluation framework throughout the project lifecycle. Before launching a GenAI solution, establish baselines for each step in the value chain—from technical metrics through to business outcomes. As the solution pilots and then scales, implement rigorous monitoring at each link in this chain. For instance, if deploying an AI marketing content generator, track not just the end metrics like conversion rates, but the entire value chain: model performance metrics, content quality metrics, campaign deployment speed, engagement rates, and ultimately sales impact. This granular visibility enables precise diagnosis of where value creation might be breaking down. If ROI falls short of expectations, the value chain mapping enables teams to pinpoint exactly where the breakdown is occurring. Is it a technical issue with the model itself? A user adoption challenge? Or perhaps a gap in the underlying business assumption about how technical capabilities would translate to business outcomes? This systematic approach to value tracking enables targeted interventions.

Companies that excel with AI tend to put strong emphasis on tracking value: they align AI metrics with business goals and hold leaders accountable for outcomes. ROI and KPI considerations should be included in the design phase of GenAI initiatives. Lastly, set a realistic timeline for ROI. GenAI can deliver quick wins, but larger transformations may take multiple iterations to realize full value. Communicate these timelines to stakeholders so they understand the trajectory of returns (e.g., an initial pilot might have modest ROI, with bigger payoffs as the solution scales and improves). This long-view perspective helps balance short-term pressure with strategic investment.
 The goal of the ROI framework is not to gatekeep innovation with rigid finance rules, but to anchor GenAI initiatives in business value from day one. By continuously evaluating outcomes, you can double down on high-ROI uses and course-correct or sunset projects that aren't delivering.
