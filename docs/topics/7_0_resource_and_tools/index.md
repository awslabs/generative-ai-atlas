# Resources and Tools

## Overview

Building generative AI applications involves using a combination of services, tools, and resources throughout the development lifecycle. This section provides an overview of these resources to help technical teams identify tools that fit their project requirements.

The section covers different approaches for implementation, such as using ready-to-use applications, building with managed services, or developing with open-source frameworks and libraries. It covers the AWS service portfolio for generative AI, alongside popular tools and frameworks commonly used throughout the industry.

By understanding the available generative AI technologies, teams can improve their efficiency and the quality of their solutions. Choosing the right resources is the foundation for successful implementation across different use cases and organizational needs.

## Key Topics Covered

This section explores several aspects of Resources and Tools, including:

* **AWS Services**: A high-level overview of the primary AWS services for Generative AI and Machine Learning that explores available capabilities from foundational infrastructure to ready-to-use applications, helping developers and architects choose the right approach for their projects.

* **Popular Tools, Libraries and Frameworks**: A comprehensive technical guide to the GenAI development landscape, covering AI Agents, model development frameworks, orchestration tools, deployment libraries, and evaluation frameworks with practical implementation patterns for common use cases.

* **Community Forums, Learning Resources, and Support**: A comprehensive directory of learning pathways, official documentation, community forums, and AWS support programs designed to accelerate development and provide expert guidance throughout your GenAI journey.
