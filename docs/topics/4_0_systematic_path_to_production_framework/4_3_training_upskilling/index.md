# Training and Upskilling

**Content Level: 300**

## TL;DR
You should take a structured, persona-based approach to training and upskilling for successful Generative AI implementation. You should address the unique learning needs of diﬀerent stakeholder groups while maintaining a balanced investment of your resources.

You should follow the AWS recommended training strategy using a 70-20-10 distribution model, reflecting your organizational composition and impact levels:

- You should focus 70% on Consumers (End Users)
- You should focus 20% on Business Leaders / LoB Owners / Decisions Makers  
- You should focus 10% on Central IT / Product / Development Teams

You can use this distribution to enable efficient resource allocation while maximizing adoption and impact across your organization.

## Your Challenges

You face significant workforce challenges in your journey to adopt AI/ML technologies. Your primary concern centers around maximizing your AI investments while dealing with widespread skills gaps across your workforce. Many of your employees remain uncertain about which Generative AI skills are most relevant for their roles, while you struggle to scale up training programs rapidly enough to keep pace with fast-evolving technology. You'll find this further complicated by your need for flexible learning approaches that accommodate diverse roles and experience levels. The talent landscape adds another layer of complexity, as you find it challenging to both hire and retain professionals with the right mix of technical and non-technical AI skills.

These challenges highlight your pressing need for strategic upskilling initiatives that can support successful AI transformation across your entire organization - from business leaders to technical teams to everyday end-users. When you address these skills-related obstacles, you can unlock the full potential of your AI investments and empower your workforce to innovate with emerging technologies like generative AI.

## Key Personas

Your AI/ML and GenAI training landscape encompasses diverse roles with distinct learning needs. Your Business Decision Makers seek strategic understanding of AI technologies to enhance customer service and operations. Your Data Scientists bring technical expertise in statistical analysis and model building, with proﬁciency in tools like Python and R, while focusing on leveraging large language models. Your MLOps Engineers bridge the gap between development and operations, specializing in productionizing models using services like Amazon SageMaker. Your Developers focus on integrating ML capabilities into applications, primarily using Python for implementation. Your Statistical Analysts apply their analytical skills to solve business problems through data services, while your Business Analysts leverage domain expertise to translate data insights into actionable business recommendations. You need tailored training approaches for each persona that align with their speciﬁc roles and technical proﬁciency levels.

You can use this segmentation to develop targeted training programs that address the unique needs and skill gaps of each role, enabling eﬀective AI/ML adoption across your enterprise.
