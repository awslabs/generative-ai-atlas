# Overview: Why a section for ISVs?

**Content Level: 100**

## Suggested Pre-Reading

This section does not require any pre-readings. It is written for SaaS professionals and provides a quick guide to developing profitable generative AI products on AWS.

## TL;DR

ISVs (independent software vendors) are a force multiplier for AWS. By partnering with ISVs and helping accelerate their success and growth, AWS creates a win-win-win with its ISV partners, their growing and happy customer base, and AWS.

Uniquely among AWS customers, ISVs have an opportunity to _sell with AWS_: to sell their products to other AWS customers, accelerating their growth. Go-to-market (GTM) partnership with AWS can be a great growth mechanism for ISVs, but it requires both access to special programs at AWS and a level of effort on the part of the ISVs to compete in a still-busy space. The next page will cover more details on this topic.

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) face unique technical complexities not typically encountered by other AWS customers. In addition to managing data and application access, ISVs must also build robust mechanisms for customer onboarding, observability, and billing. These challenges are further compounded when customers require the ISV's software to be deployed in AWS accounts outside the vendor's direct control.We will touch on these considerations later in this section as well.

For these reasons, this section provides a structured framework to help guide ISVs' journeys to launch AI products on AWS. It will not duplicate content from other sections, but instead link to them where appropriate, for content that ISVs should consider that are covered elswehere in Atlas.

## ISV-specific considerations to be covered in this section of Atlas

* Selling with AWS by taking advantage of its go-to-market programs, not just consuming AWS services.

* Cost of goods sold (COGS) and return on investment (ROI). Starting from square one with ROI in mind, and how to estimate and optimize it for generative AI. 

* Creating your own secure multi-tenant architecture with cost and hyperscalability in mind.

* Protecting intellectual property: yours and your customers'

* Control plane and data plane considerations, given the IP and multitenancy considerations.

The following pages will discuss each of these deeper considerations in turn.
