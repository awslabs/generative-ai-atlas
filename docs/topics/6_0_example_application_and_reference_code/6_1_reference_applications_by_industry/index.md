# Industry Deployments

## Overview
AWS works with customers across industries to develop and deploy sophisticated generative AI (gen AI) applications that integrate with customers' existing IT landscape, including their applications, data stores, and partner solutions. To share these valuable implementation insights, this section includes a comprehensive library of reference deployments that can help accelerate your application implementation and help ensure consistent delivery of business value.

## Key Topics Covered
Each reference deployment describes the business, architecture, and technology aspects of a given gen AI implementation. It describes AWS best practices to address common architecture and design challenges for several types of gen AI applications, including but not limited to, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), agentic AI, among others. The content of this library is organized by industry, such as:

* Automotive
* Consumer Packaged Goods
* Cross-industry (use cases are applicable to multiple industries)
* Energy and Utilities
* Financial Services
* Gaming
* Healthcare and Life Sciences
* Manufacturing and Industrial
* Media and Entertainment
* Retail
* Telecommunications

## Why It Matters
By the end of this section, you will understand:

* The art of the possible and what real-world gen AI use cases AWS customers are implementing. 
* Proven approaches to reduce time-to-market and minimize risk of gen AI applications.
* How these reference deployments can help drive revenue growth, improve customer satisfaction, increase operational efficiency, mitigate implementation risks, optimize costs, or enhance employee productivity. 

These reference deployments combined with AWS best practices can help you scale gen AI initiatives across your organization while maintaining consistent quality.

Prerequisites: Basic understanding of gen AI architecture patterns is helpful but not required.
