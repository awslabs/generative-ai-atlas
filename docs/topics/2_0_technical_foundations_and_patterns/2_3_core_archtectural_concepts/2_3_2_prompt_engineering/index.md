# Prompt Engineering

## Overview

Prompt engineering is the craft of designing effective inputs to guide AI systems toward producing desired outputs.
Rather than modifying model weights, prompt engineering focuses on optimizing how we communicate with models through carefully structured text.
By mastering components such as system messages, user instructions, context, and parameter settings, developers can dramatically improve response quality, maintain consistency, and reduce costs—all without requiring specialized machine learning expertise.

## Why It Matters

Effective prompt engineering is important when implementing generative AI in production applications.
By the end of this section you will understand how to:

1. **Design for Token Efficiency**

2. **Implement Context Management Strategies**

3. **Balance Parameters for Use Case Requirements**

4. **Evaluate Prompts for Multiple Dimensions**:
      1. Response quality (accuracy, relevance)
      2. Cost metrics (average tokens per interaction)
      3. Latency (time to first token and complete response)
      4. Robustness to input variations

With thoughtful prompt engineering practices, you can build more effective, efficient, and economical GenAI applications that deliver consistent value while avoiding common pitfalls like hallucinations, irrelevant outputs, and excessive token usage.
