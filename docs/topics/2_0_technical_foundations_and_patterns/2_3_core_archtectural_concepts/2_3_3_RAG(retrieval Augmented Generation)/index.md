# Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are a foundational component in building context-aware and knowledge-grounded applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). This section focuses on the core building blocks of RAG—including ingestion pipelines, retrieval pipelines, and generation workflows. It also covers best practices and implementation strategies for tuning RAG systems to optimize response quality and relevance across various enterprise use cases.

## Key Topics Covered
This section explores several crucial aspects of RAG including:

- [Ingestion Pipelines](./2_3_3-1-ingestion_pipelines/2_3_3-1-ingestion_pipelines.md): Data Ingestion, importance of chunking and embedding creation process.

- [Retrieval Pipelines](./2_3_3-2-Retrieval_pipelines/2.3.3.2%20Retrieval%20Pipelines.md): understanding challenges in retrieval and different types of retrieval/search techniques.

- [Generation Pipeline](./2_3_3-3-Generation_pipelines/2.3.3.3%20Generation%20Pipelines.md): core generation challenges, optimizing generation, post processing and guardrails evaluation, prompt best practices and deployment best practices.

- [Advanced RAG Patterns](./2_3_3-4-Advanced_RAG_patterns/2.3.3.4%20Advanced%20RAG%20Patterns.md): Approaches for implementing various advanced RAG patterns.

- [Performance tuning of RAG Systems](./2_3_3-5-Performance_tuning_of_RAG_systems/2.3.3.5%20Performance%20Tuning%20of%20RAG%20Systems.md): Guidelines on how to improve the RAG workflow performance.

## Why It Matters
By the end of this section, you will understand:

- How to implement the RAG pipeline

- Different patterns in the advance RAG pattern

- How to improve the performance of the RAG pipeline

- Practical techniques for implementing the RAG pipeline, along with common challenges and strategies to overcome them

Understanding these topics is important for building an effective RAG implementation, which serves as a foundational building block for most enterprise use cases. It enables large language models to operate on proprietary enterprise data while significantly reducing hallucinations.

Prerequisites: Basic understanding of Gen Core concepts and familiarity with similarity search is helpful but not required.
