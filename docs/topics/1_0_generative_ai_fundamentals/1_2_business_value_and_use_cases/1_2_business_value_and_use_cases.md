**Content Level: 100**

## TL;DR

The business value achievable with generative AI goes hand-in-hand with the use cases pursued.  Regardless of the industry a company is involved in, several patterns have emerged that represent common use cases for generative AI, including document processing, workflow automation, natural language interfaces, coding assistants, and content generation.  In order to maximize the return on investment when adopting generative AI, companies should methodically assess existing business processes and set quantifiable objectives that the use of generative AI will improve or optimize.  Depending on the industry a company operates in, there are likely already some early adopters who have demonstrated attractive use cases worth pursuing.  One of the best places to start for use case inspiration for Generative AI is a review of a company's current business objectives.  Aligning a Generative AI solution to those key objectives helps ensure executive sponsorship and alignment, sources of funding, and already-quantified ROI criteria. 

## Business Value

### Ensuring GenAI Drives Business Value

The journey to unlock business value through generative AI begins with a structured, collaborative approach involving key stakeholders across the organization. Success requires the formation of a cross-functional team that brings together diverse perspectives and expertise. This team should include business unit leaders who understand operational needs, technology executives who can assess technical feasibility, process owners who comprehend day-to-day workflows, and subject matter experts who can identify specific opportunities for improvement.

The initial phase of work requires this team to conduct a comprehensive assessment of current business processes. They should focus particular attention on areas where existing workflows show clear opportunities for transformation. Key areas to evaluate include:

* High-volume, repetitive tasks that consume significant human resources
* Processes with notable creative or analytical bottlenecks
* Operations with high error rates or quality inconsistencies
* Customer-facing activities with potential for enhancement
* Resource-intensive workflows that could benefit from automation

### Systematic Approach to Value Assessment

The process of determining potential business value from generative AI implementations demands a methodical and thorough approach. Organizations must begin by carefully mapping out current process workflows and identifying specific pain points where AI could provide meaningful improvements. This analysis should consider both quantitative and qualitative factors, examining not just the direct cost implications but also the broader impact on organizational effectiveness.

A critical component of this assessment phase is the establishment of clear baseline metrics against which future improvements can be measured. These metrics should encompass traditional financial measures such as operational costs and productivity rates, but also extend to broader indicators such as customer satisfaction scores, employee engagement levels, and quality metrics. This comprehensive baseline provides the foundation for measuring the real impact of AI implementations.

The validation of potential value should be conducted through carefully designed pilot programs in selected areas of the business. These pilots serve multiple purposes: they provide real-world data on the effectiveness of AI solutions, help identify implementation challenges before broader rollout, and generate concrete evidence to support larger-scale initiatives. The insights gained from these pilots become invaluable in building compelling business cases and ensuring resources are allocated to initiatives with the highest potential return on investment.

### Earning GenAI Sponsorship from Executives

Securing executive support requires a carefully crafted approach that speaks directly to business outcomes and strategic objectives. The most effective engagement strategy focuses on demonstrating how generative AI initiatives align with and support existing business priorities. Key considerations for executive engagement include:

* Strategic alignment with business objectives
* Clear articulation of expected benefits and ROI
* Realistic assessment of risks and challenges
* Comprehensive change management approach
* Resource requirements and timeline projections

The presentation of opportunities to executive leadership should be grounded in concrete examples and data from pilot programs or relevant industry case studies. It's essential to frame the discussion around specific business challenges that executives are already focused on solving, such as improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer experience, or accelerating innovation. The narrative should emphasize how generative AI serves as a strategic enabler for achieving broader business objectives rather than being presented as a technology initiative in isolation.

Success in implementing generative AI initiatives ultimately depends on maintaining a clear focus on business value throughout the process. This means regularly revisiting and refining the value assessment as implementations progress, ensuring that the promised benefits are being realized, and making adjustments as needed to optimize outcomes. By maintaining this disciplined approach to value identification and realization, organizations can better position themselves for successful generative AI implementation while ensuring sustained executive support throughout the journey.

### Measuring and Tracking ROI

Post-implementation measurement and tracking of ROI requires establishing a robust feedback loop that connects initial value projections with actual results. Organizations should implement regular cadence reviews that track both quantitative metrics (cost savings, revenue growth, ROI, productivity gains, error reduction rates) and qualitative outcomes (user satisfaction, process improvements, team efficiency). Success metrics should be documented in a measurement framework that includes: baseline metrics captured pre-implementation, target improvement goals, actual performance data, and variance analysis. This framework should be reviewed monthly or quarterly, with findings used to refine existing implementations and inform future GenAI initiatives. Companies that excel at ROI tracking often establish a dedicated analytics function within their AI governance structure to maintain measurement consistency and ensure learnings are captured and shared across the organization.

## Use Cases

### What Makes a Good Use Case
Successful generative AI use cases typically share fundamental characteristics that drive business value while ensuring technical feasibility. Organizations must evaluate potential use cases across multiple dimensions to ensure they meet core criteria for success. The most impactful use cases demonstrate clear return on investment through quantifiable metrics such as cost reduction, revenue generation, or process efficiency improvements.

Key characteristics of viable use cases include:

Process automation solutions enhance workflow efficiency by generating standard operating procedures, automating routine decision-making tasks, and providing intelligent workflow routing.


### Early Industry-Specific Use Cases

Different industries have begun leveraging generative AI in unique ways that address their particular challenges and opportunities. 

The **financial services** industry has been an early adopter, implementing solutions for regulatory compliance documentation, financial document analysis & synthesis, risk analysis reports, automated trading strategy recommendations.  However, financial services organizations face distinct challenges implementing GenAI, including strict regulatory requirements around model explainability, data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA), and the need for extremely high accuracy in financial calculations and risk assessments. Model governance and audit requirements can significantly impact implementation timelines and complexity. 

**Healthcare** organizations have found significant value in medical record summarization, clinical documentation, and treatment planning assistance. These applications must carefully balance efficiency improvements with medical accuracy and regulatory compliance. The ability to generate clear, accurate medical documentation while maintaining patient privacy and regulatory requirements has proven particularly valuable.  Healthcare implementations must navigate significant hurdles around HIPAA compliance, medical data privacy, and the critical nature of medical decision support. Organizations must carefully manage liability concerns and ensure AI-generated content undergoes thorough clinical review. Integration with legacy healthcare systems and ensuring consistent performance across diverse patient populations present additional challenges.

Both the healthcare and financial services industries have long pursued many of these use cases with more traditional forms of AI and Machine Learning, including the use of optical character recognition (OCR) on financial and healthcare related documents.  GenAI has proven to be more accurate and able to handle more complex documentation inputs when compared to these prior approaches, make these industries ripe for early and aggressive adoption to GenAI services.

**Manufacturing** companies utilize generative AI across their operations, including:

* Maintenance procedure generation and optimization
* Quality control documentation and analysis
* Supply chain optimization and forecasting
* Product design iteration and validation
* Technical specification generation

Key limitations in manufacturing implementations often center around integration with existing operational technology (OT) systems, ensuring AI recommendations align with physical constraints and safety requirements, and managing the complexity of global supply chain variables. Real-time performance requirements and the need to maintain production continuity can restrict implementation options.

**Retail businesses** have leveraged these technologies to transform their customer engagement and operations management. Applications include product description generation, personalized marketing content creation, and inventory management forecasting. These implementations often focus on creating scalable, personalized customer experiences while optimizing backend operations.

Retail organizations frequently struggle with data quality across disparate systems, seasonal volatility in demand patterns, and the need to maintain brand consistency across AI-generated content. Integration with legacy point-of-sale systems and inventory management platforms can complicate implementations, while ensuring consistent customer experience across digital and physical channels presents ongoing challenges.

**Professional services** firms have found particular value in using generative AI for contract analysis, proposal generation, and research synthesis. These implementations often focus on accelerating routine tasks while maintaining high quality standards and professional expertise. The ability to quickly generate first drafts of documents while preserving firm-specific knowledge and best practices has proven especially valuable.

Professional services firms must carefully balance automation with maintaining professional standards and judgment. Challenges include managing client confidentiality, ensuring AI-generated work product meets regulatory and professional liability requirements, and maintaining appropriate human oversight of AI-assisted work. The highly contextual nature of professional services work can limit the effectiveness of generic AI solutions.

The success of industry-specific implementations often depends on effectively combining domain expertise with AI capabilities. Organizations must carefully balance automation opportunities with industry-specific requirements for accuracy, compliance, and quality control. The most successful implementations typically start with well-defined, industry-specific use cases that demonstrate clear value while managing implementation complexity.


## Making It Practical

If a company is serious about the impact generative AI will have on their business, its important to begin a strategic adoption journey that incorporates being methodical with the problems AI will be applied to and assembling the right stakeholders, SMEs, and sponsors to achieve success.  One of the *least* productive things companies could do when adopting generative AI, and what many currently are doing, is to focus on the creation of isolated POCs for the purpose of impressing executives, customers, and investors.  Doing so will frequently result in no tangible organizational progress towards what it takes to bring generative AI use cases to production. And it rarely results in an application concept with a strong business case.  Quantifying the value that improvements to a company's highest scale or most frequently executed business process is a great way to secure sponsorship from company executive leadership.  Generative AI should be leveraged as a disrupter and force multiplier for key existing (and expensive) activities an organization already invests heavily in and depends on.  

Keep in mind that in order to succeed as a disruptive force within any context at an organization, technical builders should be conscious of who the key sponsors in an organization are that would benefit from or potentially be threatened by the disruption AI might drive. 

Success with generative AI implementations depends heavily on effective change management and overcoming organizational resistance. Organizations should develop a comprehensive change management strategy that includes clear communication about the vision and benefits, robust training programs to build confidence and capabilities, and transparent discussion about how roles will evolve rather than be replaced. A phased implementation approach, starting with receptive teams and building on early successes, helps build momentum while providing opportunities to refine the adoption strategy. Leadership must consistently demonstrate their commitment through active participation and support, while establishing feedback mechanisms to identify and address concerns quickly. Remember that resistance often stems from uncertainty - maintaining open dialogue and celebrating successful adoption helps create a culture where GenAI is viewed as an augmentation of human capabilities rather than a threat to them.
