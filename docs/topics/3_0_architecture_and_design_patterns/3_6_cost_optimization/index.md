# Cost Estimation, Optimization, and Management for Generative AI Workloads

**Content Level: 200**


Once the business benefit of a GenAI application has been established, cost effective operations of the application become a key driver to deriving business value. Especially at scale, GenAI application can be expensive to operate, so choosing the right architecture and tools can make the difference in the success of a product. Additionally, given the resource constraints for the hardware that powers the GenAI applications, an efficient architecture might be the only way to scale up to meet customer demand.

## TL;DR

The journey of implementing generative AI begins with Business Strategy and Value Assessment, progressing through stages of Quick Wins, Process Reshaping, and Business Reinvention while aligning with core pillars of Growth/Innovation, Cost/Efficiency, and Customer Risk Management. Cost Estimation follows, requiring detailed understanding of model inference costs, multimodal data considerations, and various pricing models, with cost tracking and monitoring becoming essential as applications mature. Throughout implementation, organizations must balance optimization strategies and supporting infrastructure costs while considering multi-tenant cost models for effective management and scaling of AI workloads across departments.
